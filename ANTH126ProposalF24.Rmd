# Background - Significance and Prevalence

- affects 1 in 1,000 children, causing long-term disability

--

- high costs due to treatments, hospital visits, and therapies

--

- early-life stress may trigger JIA in genetically predisposed children

--

- early-life stress disrupts cortisol, potentially worsening inflammation and disease

# What is Currently Known?

- dysregulated cortisol responses are associated with autoimmune diseases

--

- relationship between early-life environmental stressors & long-term immune and endocrine system dysregulation

--

- joint inflammation, cytokine levels, and pain scores are standard indicators used to assess 
disease severity in JIA

---

# The Current Gap

- pathways linking early-life stress and cortisol

--

- mechanisms connecting cortisol dysregulation to disease severity

--

- the role of cortisol in inflammation and pain

--

- biological mechanisms linking stress and JIA progression


---
# Research Question

How do early-life environmental stressors alter the regulation of cortisol in children 

with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and what are the **mechanistic pathways** through which 

these cortisol changes influence immune function, inflammation, and disease severity indicators, 

such as joint inflammation, inflammatory cytokine levels, and pain scores?

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```

---

# Hypothesis

- Elevated cortisol levels in children with JIA, measured following specific early-life 
environmental stress exposures (eg. ACE’s), will be predictive of higher disease severity and 
more rapid progression of joint inflammation and damage.

--

- Alternatively, children with JIA who display blunted cortisol responses to stress are more 
likely to experience severe disease, as this may indicate an impaired adaptive stress response 
mechanism.

--

- Null: No relationship between those with elevated cortisol levels with JIA, following ACE’s → 
not predictive of disease severity, progression, or damage.

# Data Collection 1

**Biological Samples**:

- Salivary Cortisol: Collected at morning, midday, and evening visit + pre/post-stress test (Trier Social Stress Test for Children)

--

- Blood Samples: Collected at each time point for inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6), drawn within 30 minutes post-stress test

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("bloodchild.jpg")
```

---

# Data Collection 2

**Environmental Stressor Assessment**:

- Parental surveys on early-life stressors (e.g., air pollution, family stress,                    socioeconomic factors).

--

- Annual follow-up surveys for environmental changes.

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("parent.jpg")
```

---

# Data Collection 3

**Disease Severity Measures**:

- Joint Inflammation: Clinical evaluation and imaging (MRI/ultrasound) every 6 months

--

- Pain Scores: Self-reported scales (e.g., Wong-Baker FACES)

--

- Functional Status: JIA assessments (e.g., Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire)
`

---

# Proposed Analysis

- Independent: Early-life stress (type/intensity), acute stress cortisol response (salivary cortisol pre/post-test)

--

- Dependent: Disease severity (joint inflammation, TNF-alpha, IL-6, pain, function)

--

- Additional: Baseline cortisol, diurnal variation

# Statistical Method 1

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Simulate data for 1000 JIA patients and 1000 age-matched controls
set.seed(123)
n <- 2000  # Total number of participants

  ID = 1:n,
  Age = sample(6:16, n, replace = TRUE),  # Age range from 6 to 16 years
  Sex = sample(c("Male", "Female"), n, replace = TRUE),  # Sex of the participants
  Group = rep(c("JIA", "Control"), each = n/2),  # JIA patients and controls
  
  Early_Life_Stress = rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10),  # Early-life stress (survey score)
  Cortisol_Morning = rnorm(n, mean = 5, sd = 1.5),  # Morning cortisol levels
  Cortisol_Midday = rnorm(n, mean = 4.5, sd = 1.5),  # Midday cortisol levels
  Cortisol_Evening = rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5),  # Evening cortisol levels
  Cortisol_PreStress = rnorm(n, mean = 6, sd = 1.5),  # Pre-stress cortisol level
  Cortisol_PostStress = rnorm(n, mean = 7, sd = 1.5),  # Post-stress cortisol level
  
  TNF_alpha = rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 5),  # Inflammatory marker TNF-alpha (pg/mL)

  Pain_Score = rnorm(n, mean = 5, sd = 2),  # Pain score (Wong-Baker Faces)
  Function_Score = rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 3),  # Functional status (JIA Assessment)
  
  Environmental_Stress = rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 15),  # Environmental stress (pollution, family stress)
  Socioeconomic_Status = sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), n, replace = TRUE)  # Socioeconomic status
)
```

**Group Comparisons**: t-tests/ANOVA for baseline comparisons; mixed-effects models for repeated measures.

--

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# T-test for cortisol levels at different times (morning vs. evening)
t_test_cortisol <- t.test(Cortisol_Morning ~ Group, data = data)
print(t_test_cortisol)

# ANOVA for cortisol pre/post-stress test between groups (JIA vs. Controls)
anova_cortisol <- aov(Cortisol_PostStress ~ Group, data = data)
summary(anova_cortisol)

# Long-format data for repeated measures
library(tidyr)
long_data <- pivot_longer(data, cols = starts_with("Cortisol"),
                          names_to = "Cortisol_Type", values_to = "Cortisol_Level")

# Mixed-effects model for repeated measures of cortisol
library(lme4)
mixed_model <- lmer(Cortisol_Level ~ Cortisol_Type * Group + (1 | ID), data = long_data)
summary(mixed_model)

```

# Statistical Method 2

**Correlations**: Pearson/Spearman to link cortisol and disease severity.

--

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Pearson correlation between cortisol and disease severity measures (TNF-alpha, joint inflammation)
cor_cortisol_tnf <- cor.test(data$Cortisol_PostStress, data$TNF_alpha, method = "pearson")
print(cor_cortisol_tnf)

cor_cortisol_inflammation <- cor.test(data$Cortisol_PostStress, data$Joint_Inflammation, method = "pearson")
print(cor_cortisol_inflammation)

```

# Multiple linear regression for joint inflammation prediction
regression_model <- lm(Joint_Inflammation ~ Early_Life_Stress + Cortisol_PostStress + TNF_alpha + IL6, data = data)
summary(regression_model)

```

---

# Statistical Method 4

**Path Analysis**: SEM to assess pathways linking stress, cortisol, and JIA severity.

--

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Install lavaan for SEM
if (!requireNamespace("lavaan", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("lavaan")
library(lavaan)

# Define SEM model
sem_model <- '
  # Direct effects
  Cortisol_PostStress ~ Early_Life_Stress
  TNF_alpha ~ Cortisol_PostStress
  Joint_Inflammation ~ TNF_alpha + Cortisol_PostStress
  # Indirect effects
  Joint_Inflammation ~ Early_Life_Stress
'

# Fit SEM model
sem_fit <- sem(sem_model, data = data)
summary(sem_fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

```

# Concluding Remarks

**Mixed-effects models and SEM handle repeated measures, linking cortisol and immune responses to disease progression/severity**
