# Background - Significance and Prevalence

- affects 1 in 1,000 children, causing long-term disability

--

- high costs due to treatments, hospital visits, and therapies

--

- early-life stress may trigger JIA in genetically predisposed children

--

- early-life stress disrupts cortisol, potentially worsening inflammation and disease

# What is Currently Known?

- dysregulated cortisol responses are associated with autoimmune diseases

--

- relationship between early-life environmental stressors & long-term immune and endocrine system dysregulation

--

- joint inflammation, cytokine levels, and pain scores are standard indicators used to assess 
disease severity in JIA

---

# The Current Gap

- pathways linking early-life stress and cortisol

--

- mechanisms connecting cortisol dysregulation to disease severity

--

- the role of cortisol in inflammation and pain

--

- biological mechanisms linking stress and JIA progression

# Research Question

How do early-life environmental stressors alter the regulation of cortisol in children 

with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and what are the **mechanistic pathways** through which 

these cortisol changes influence immune function, inflammation, and disease severity indicators, 

such as joint inflammation, inflammatory cytokine levels, and pain scores?

# Hypothesis

- Elevated cortisol levels in children with JIA, measured following specific early-life 
environmental stress exposures (eg. ACE’s), will be predictive of higher disease severity and 
more rapid progression of joint inflammation and damage.

--

- Alternatively, children with JIA who display blunted cortisol responses to stress are more 
likely to experience severe disease, as this may indicate an impaired adaptive stress response 
mechanism.

--

- Null: No relationship between those with elevated cortisol levels with JIA, following ACE’s → 
not predictive of disease severity, progression, or damage.


---

# Prediction 1

Children with JIA who were exposed to early-life stressors will have significantly higher 

baseline cortisol levels and exhibit an exaggerated cortisol response when subjected to mild 

stress (eg. a standardized stress test) compared to children with JIA who did not experience such 

early-life stress.

# Prediction 2

Baseline and stress-induced cortisol levels in children with JIA will correlate positively with 

markers of disease severity, such as the number of inflamed joints, levels of inflammatory 

cytokines (eg. TNF-alpha, IL-6), and clinical pain scores.

# Prediction 3 (Addressing the Alternative)

Children with blunted cortisol responses may exhibit alternative markers of disease severity, 

such as greater radiographic evidence of joint damage or increased autoantibody titers.

# Proposed Methods

Sample Size: ~1000 JIA patients (6-16 years) and ~1000 age-matched controls.

Age Range: 6-16 years to capture disease onset and progression.

Sex: Both males and females to assess sex differences in cortisol and disease severity.

Location: Recruited from urban/rural U.S. clinics with varying environmental exposures (e.g., pollution).


Inclusion Criteria:

- JIA diagnosis within the past 2 years
- No other autoimmune or chronic conditions
- Controls: No autoimmune history


Exclusion Criteria:

- On corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs
- Psychiatric conditions or treatments affecting cortisol
- History of severe, unrelated trauma

# Data Collection

Timeline: 2 years, with assessments at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months.


Biological Samples:

- Salivary Cortisol: Collected at morning, midday, and evening visits, plus pre/post-stress test (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test for Children).
- Blood Samples: Collected at each time point for inflammatory markers (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6), drawn within 30 minutes post-stress test.


Environmental Stressor Assessment:
- Parental surveys on early-life stressors (e.g., air pollution, family stress,                    socioeconomic factors).
- Annual follow-up surveys for environmental changes.


Disease Severity Measures:

- Joint Inflammation: Clinical evaluation and imaging (MRI/ultrasound) every 6 months.
- Pain Scores: Self-reported scales (e.g., Wong-Baker FACES).
- Functional Status: JIA assessments (e.g., Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire).

---

# Proposed Analysis

Variables:

- Independent: Early-life stress (type/intensity), acute stress cortisol response (salivary cortisol pre/post-test).
- Dependent: Disease severity (joint inflammation, TNF-alpha, IL-6, pain, function).
- Additional: Baseline cortisol, diurnal variation.

--

Analysis:

Cortisol: Measured via EIA for baseline and stress-induced levels.

Inflammatory Markers: Quantified via ELISA (TNF-alpha, IL-6).
Statistical Methods:

Group Comparisons: t-tests/ANOVA for baseline comparisons; mixed-effects models for repeated measures.

Correlations: Pearson/Spearman to link cortisol and disease severity.

Regression: Predict stress exposure impact on cortisol and disease.

Path Analysis: SEM to assess pathways linking stress, cortisol, and JIA severity.

--

Justification: Mixed-effects models and SEM handle repeated measures, linking cortisol and immune responses to disease progression.
